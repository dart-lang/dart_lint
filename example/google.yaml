# The following lints will NOT be enforced for google internal code.
#
# avoid_relative_lib_imports
#   This is enforced as part of the build rather than as a lint. Since it's
#   effectively enabled it appears in the above list, too.
# empty_statements
#   Enforcing use of dartfmt is sufficient to make empty statements obvious.
#   Also, see issue #383 for discussion of false positives.
